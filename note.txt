The content of this branch reflects a local change of calculate_rmsd.py
to provide in one run both the RMSD of the Kabsch test, as well as .xyz
file about the successful superposition of the two model data; a commit
by March 28, 2019.  It was deposit for a pull request #54 at the root of
the project,

https://github.com/charnley/rmsd

Eventually, the changes were not considered for an inclusion into the
root of the project.  It is more suitable to constrain the changes to
a local forking repository, i.e. within

https://github.com/nbehrnd/rmsd

for which this branch 'RMSD_and_xyz' was created.  This equally allows
to update the local 'master' branch (again) to reflect the 'master'
branch maintained by Jimmy Charnley.
